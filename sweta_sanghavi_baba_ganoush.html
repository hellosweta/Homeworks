        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 medium or 3/4 of a large eggplant</li>
          <li>1 large clove garlic, grated or finely minced</li>
          <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
          <li>2 Tbsp Tahini</li>
          <li>Sea salt</li>
          <li>Optional: 2 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <A NAME="Directions">
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to high broil (or medium if you have the ability) and position a rack at the top of the oven.</li>
          <li>Slice your eggplant into 1/4 inch rounds and sprinkle with sea salt and place in a colander in the sink to drain any excess liquid. After 10 minutes, rinse slightly and then pat dry between two towels.</li>
          <li>Arrange on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. Roast for 5-10 minutes, turning once or twice, until the eggplant is softened and golden brown. Remove from pan, stack and wrap the rounds in foil to lock in moisture â€“ wait 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Peel away most of the skin of the eggplant (a little is OK) and add flesh to a food processor. It should be soft and tender and the skin should come off easy.</li>
          <li>Add lemon juice, garlic, tahini, a pinch of salt and mix until creamy. Add herbs last and pulse to incorporate. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more tahini and another pinch of salt.</li>
          <li>Serve with pita and/or pita chips and veggies. Will keep covered in the fridge for several days.</li>
